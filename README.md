# HDHelper

This is a console application that can be deployed to an end users machine to help speed up the troubleshooting process for Help Desk Employees.

Utilizing this software could mitigate the need for excessive remote sessions as it simplifies the commands down to allow the end user to follow verbal prompts from a technician.

## Verion Notes

This is the very first proof of concept version of this application.

At this time there are several key features that have not been built into this application that will be included at a later time such as:

- Admin elevation for DISM/SFC
- Future commands added
- Additional security to keep end users from using this software when not in contact with a technician
- More!

Please let me know if you think of a feature that would be helpful in this app!
